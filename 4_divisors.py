#Exercise 4
#Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
# For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

x = int(input("Enter a number - "))
n = 1
y = []

while n <= x:
    if x%n == 0:
        y.append(n)
    n = n + 1

print ("List of divisors for the number " + str(x) + " is:")
print (y)
